      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p >CoreLoft Homes was created with a simple idea: to make homebuilding better for more people.</p>
      <p>Our team is made up of designers, builders, and suppliers who believe homes should be throughtfully thoughtful, well-built, and naturally better to live in.</p>
      <p >From path-breaking floorplans to initive layouts that follow the way you live, each detail has the same aim: sensible, effective, and worthy of your investment.</p>
      <p>At CoreLoft, we are committed to sidestep construction without sakrificing form or livability.</p>
